Date()
MongoDB stores dates as 64-bit integers representing milliseconds since the Unix
epoch (January 1, 1970). The time zone is not stored:

    {"x" : new Date()}

Object ID
An object ID is a 12-byte ID for documents:

    {"x" : ObjectId()}

"$push" adds elements to the end of an array if the array exists and
creates a new array if it does not.
